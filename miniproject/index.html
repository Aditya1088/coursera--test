<div class="collapse" id="gravitational">
  <div class="card card-body">
   Any two bodies attract each other by virtue of their masses and this attractive force is called as Gravitational force. The force of attraction between two point masses is F = (G*m1*m2)/r^2 where m1 and m2 are the masses of the particle and r is the distance between them and G is the universal constant having the value 6.67 * 10^-11 N-m^2/kg^2.

<div class="collapse" id="electromagnetic">
  <div class="card card-body">
   The electromagnetic force is a type of physical interaction that occurs between electrically charged particles. It acts between charged particles and is the combination of all magnetic and electrical forces. The electromagnetic force can be attractive or repulsive. The electromagntic force is find out by F = (k*q1*q2)/r^2 where q1 and q2 are charges on two particles respectively and k is a constant whose value is 9.0 * 10^9 N-m^2/C^2.

   The force occured betwween nucleus of an atom other than electromagnetic and gravitational forces are known as nucleus force . This force is shot range but yet it is the strongest force in the world. The changes of atom during a radiation is also done by force which is different from other forces and this force is known as weak forces.

   Friction is a force between two surfaces that are sliding, or trying to slide, across each other. For example, when you try to push a book along the floor, friction makes this difficult. Friction always works in the direction opposite to the direction in which the object is moving, or trying to move.

   (ii) Kinetic friction :- When two solid bodies slip over each other , the force of friction is called kinetic friction.

    The angle in radians (degrees, revolutions) through which a point or line has been rotated in a specified sense about a specified axis is called angular position. || The rate of change of angular position is called angular velocity.

  Centrifugal force is a force that arises from the body's inertia and appears to act on a body that is moving in a circular path which is directed away from the centre around which the body is moving. In physics, the Coriolis force is an inertial or fictitious force that acts on objects that are in motion within a frame of reference that rotates with respect to an inertial frame.

  In physics , a collision is any event in which two or more bodies exert forces on each other in a relatively short time. There are 3 types of collision - (i) Elastic collision :- In this type of collision kinetic energy remains constant  (ii) Inelastic collision :- In this type of collision some of the kinetic energy get lost.  (iii) Plastic collision :- In this type of collision one object get stuck to the other object resulting the loss of kinetic energy.

  	The coefficient of restitution also denoted by (e) is the ratio of the final to initial relative velocity between two objects after they collide . It normally ranges from 0 to 1 where 1 would be a perfectly elastic collision.

<div class="collapse" id="impulse">
  <div class="card card-body">
  An impulsive force is a force that acts for a very short duration of time on an object. An impulsive force is mainly generated in a collision that results in a change in velocity or momentum of the one or all objects involved in the collision.

        Mechanics is the area of physics concerned with the motions of physical objects, more specifically the relationships among force, matter, and motion. Forces applied to objects result in displacements, or changes of an object's position relative to its environment.

    Torque is the measure of the force that can cause an object to rotate about an axis. Force is what causes an object to accelerate in linear kinematics.

    Angular momentum is the rotational equivalent of linear momentum. Angular moment of a particle about a point O is defined as l = r*p where p is the linear momentum and r is the position vector of the particle from the given point O. If the total external torque on a system is zero, its angular momentum remains constant. This is known as the principle of conservation of angular momentum.

    Moment of inertia of a continious mass distribution is as follows :- <n/>
    (i) Uniform rod about a perpendicular bisector : ML<sup>2</sup>/12
    (ii) Circular ring about its axis (the line perpendicular to the plane of the ring through its centre) : MR<sup>2</sup> 
    (iii) Uniform circular plate about its axis : MR<sup>2</sup>/2
    (iv) Hollow cylinder about its axis : MR<sup>2</sup>
    (v) Uniform solid cylinder about its axis : MR<sup>2</sup>/2

   The moment of inertia of a body about an axis parallel to the body passing through its center is equal to the sum of moment of inertia of body about the axis passing through the center and product of mass of the body times the square of distance between the two axes. It is the first theorem. I = I(0)+ Md^2, where d is the distance between previous axis and new axis

   The perpendicular axis theorem states that the moment of inertia, for any axis which is perpendicular to the plane, is equal to the sum of any two perpendicular axes of the body which intersects with the first axis. I(z)=I(x)+I(y).

   Rolling is a type of motion that combines rotation and translation of that object with respect to a surface (either one or the other moves), such that, if ideal conditions exist, the two are in contact with each other without sliding. Rolling where there is no sliding is referred to as pure rolling. By definition, there is no sliding when there is a frame of reference in which all points of contact on the rolling object have the same velocity as their counterparts on the surface on which the object rolls; in particular, for a frame of reference in which the rolling plane is at rest.

<div class="collapse" id="gyration">
  <div class="card card-body">
   Radius of gyration or gyradius of a body about an axis of rotation is defined as the radial distance to a point which would have a moment of inertia the same as the body's actual distribution of mass, if the total mass of the body were concentrated there. Mathematically the radius of gyration is the root mean square distance of the object's parts from either its center of mass or a given axis, depending on the relevant application. It is actually the perpendicular distance from point mass to the axis of rotation. One can represent a trajectory of a moving point as a body. Then radius of gyration can be used to characterize the typical distance travelled by this point.

   If an object is rolling without slipping, then its kinetic energy can be expressed as the sum of the translational kinetic energy of its center of mass plus the rotational kinetic energy about the center of mass.
  </div>
</div>

        Objects showing rotational motion move with an angular velocity. Both these velocities are constant unless changed externally. In the translational motion, the acceleration is inversely proportional to mass and directly proportional to the force. In rotational motion, force is substituted by torque.
